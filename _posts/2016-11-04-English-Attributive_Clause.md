# 定语是什么

定语就是一个修饰名词或代词的东西

----------

# 限制性定语从句

## 如何合并

1. The man is Mr. Wu.
2. The man is watching a guinea pig*(荷兰猪，即豚鼠)*.

The man is Mr. Wu and he is watching a guinea pig.

对吗？对，但应该这样：

The man who is watching a guinea pig is Mr. Wu.

## 组成部分剖析

上例中：

- The man：先行词（被修饰的词）
- who：关系代词（用来替代重复的词语的词）
- who is watching a guinea pig：从句

## 关系词

### 关系代词：

#### 修饰物

- which

#### 修饰人

- who（可以修饰主语或宾语）
- whom（仅可修饰宾语）
- whose（仅可修饰宾语）

#### 通用

- that

**注意*、：*that*太口语，尽量不要用，但有例外，见下。

### 关系副词

- when
- where
- why

#### 时间状语：when

1. I want to know the place.
2. I was born there*(**=**in there)*.

## 一些常见的问题、例外

### 单复数问题

关系词本身没有单复数，从句单复数由先行词确定。

#### 只能用that的情况

#### 先行词是一下之一时：

- few
- little
- none
- anything
- everything
- something
- nothing
- any
- all

*三少四thing一个any一个all*

#### 当先行词被含定冠词the的形容词修饰时，或有the very，the only，the same修饰时

The first thing that I should do is to finish my homeword.

#### 主句由who或which开头是，为避免重复，关系词用that

Who is the girl that spoke to you just now?

*注意*：前面是which时后面可以用who，相反亦然

#### 先行词中同时包括人和物时

### 只能用which的情况

- 逗号后
- 介词后

### 定语从句的省略

从句是**被动语态**时可以省略关系词和be动词

The house *(which was)* destroyed by the fire was the home of a great writer.

----------

# 非限制性定语从句

### 先来见识见识

His father**, who world in Beijing,** came back yesterday.

### 与限制性定语从句的区别

- 限制性定语从句与先行词之间不用逗号隔开，而非限制性定语从句与先行词之间要用逗号隔开

- 限制性定语从句和先行词关系密切，如果去掉从句，主句意思往往不明确；非限制性定语从句只是先行词的补充或说明，去掉也不会影响主句的意思

### 使用场合

- 当先行词是地名、人名、世界上独一无二的事物或家庭唯一成员时，通常用非限制性定语从句

  Hangzhou, one of the most beautiful city in China, now is developing rapidly.

  Xiaoming, who used to be poor in math, is good at math now.

- 先行词是整个句子的时候，通常使用which引导的非限制性定语从句

  He is from America, which I know from his accent.

### 关系词

#### 关系代词

- as（不一定能用which代替）
- which（一定可以用as代替）
- who
- whom
- whose

#### 关系副词

- when
- where

非限制性定语从句中关系词**不能**省略

## as的用法

大多数时候与which意思相同，但**一般**只有以下情况使用as，其余用which

- 定语从句前置时

  As we all know, he is good at math.

- 带有“正如”的意思

  As is expected, he won the competition.  
  *(正如所预料的, ……)*
