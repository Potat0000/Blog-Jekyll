Dear Dave,

You received a schedule for English day from us last week, but for some reason, something on the schedule is changed. Now let me tell you some details of these changes.

First of all, the English talk show which is supposed to be held at around 12:30-14:00 will be put off half an hour, because the actors of the show thought that they didn't have enough time to prepare. Second the English Corner is gonna be moved to school hall in order to avoid raining.

Hope you will have a good day!

Li Ping
